# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to create a code that will help our client Steve to analyze stocks from any given year. We first made a code to analyze a certain amount of tickers for the years 2017 and 2018. We then refactored the code to be able to add any other tickers he may wish to add, as well as to run thecode more efficiently and there for faster.

## Summary 


### Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring a code;
The advantages to refactoring a code is making the code easier to run and also easier to understand for other people looking at it. A refactored code will have a lot less potential errors than its previous code. The disadvantages is that by refactoring a code, you are potentially breaking up a code that already works, and it may take manny attempts to be able to find a correct refactor that ones without errors.
### How did these pros and cons apply to the refactoring of the original VBA script?
The connection of my above statement to the code that we refactored for this analysis is fairly straightforward. The code has less potential errors in it han the first code, and runs faster than the original as well. The cons being that it took me some time and many attempts to refactor the code to where I wanted it to be.
